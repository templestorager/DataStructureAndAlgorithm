// Problem Description
/*
    We are given an array A of N lowercase letter strings, all of the same length. Now, we may choose
    set of deletion indices, and for each string, we delete all the characters in those indices.˜
    
    For example, if we have an array A = ["abcdef","uvwxyz"] and deletion indices {0, 2, 3}, 
    then the final array after deletions is ["bef", "vyz"], and the remaining columns of A are 
    ["b","v"], ["e","y"], and ["f","z"].  (Formally, the c-th column is [A[0][c], A[1][c], ..., 
    A[A.length-1][c]].)
    Suppose we chose a set of deletion indices D such that after deletions, each remaining column
    in A is in non-decreasing sorted order.

    Return the minimum possible value of D.length.
    
    Example 1:

    Input: ["cba","daf","ghi"]
    Output: 1
    Explanation: 
    After choosing D = {1}, each column ["c","d","g"] and ["a","f","i"] are in non-decreasing sorted order.
    If we chose D = {}, then a column ["b","a","h"] would not be in non-decreasing sorted order.
    Example 2:

    Input: ["a","b"]
    Output: 0
    Explanation: D = {}
    Example 3:

    Input: ["zyx","wvu","tsr"]
    Output: 3
    Explanation: D = {0, 1, 2}
    Note:
    1 <= A.length <= 100
    1 <= A[i].length <= 1000
